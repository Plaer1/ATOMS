## Install:

### [Download and install Millennium](https://github.com/SteamClientHomebrew/Millennium) to a folder on your pc*
This will be the app you use to install/manage steam skins.
â€Ž â€Ž 

â€Ž 
### Download and extract the skin folder (``ATOMS``) to:
``%steamdata%/steamui/skins``

â€Ž 
### When you first open Millennium and select the ATOMS skin it will warn you that you need to enable JavaScript, if you do not do this, the theme WILL NOT work!


## Features:
* Built from the ground up to be highly configurable, there are already plenty of settings in the ``config.css`` with more to come!

* Theme'd basically every page in Steam, *if you see* **anything** *that doesn't look theme'd at all*, ***please*** fill out a bug report or contact me on discord!

* Skip the age gate on store pages (***make sure to fill out your real birthday in the file***: ``utility.js``**!!**).

* Is there any deal integration:
![ATOMS ITAD](https://github.com/Plaer1/ATOMS-Media/blob/ddf4d9a452b3f83752d7aa7d8b0a05a37378fd1e/steamitad.png)

* Removed bottom menu and moved buttons to top right:
![ATOMS Bar Buttons](https://github.com/Plaer1/ATOMS-Media/blob/ddf4d9a452b3f83752d7aa7d8b0a05a37378fd1e/steamTopRightBar.png)

* Moved "Root" menu to it's own hidden menu:
![ATOMS Root Menu](https://github.com/Plaer1/ATOMS-Media/blob/ddf4d9a452b3f83752d7aa7d8b0a05a37378fd1e/steamRootMenu.png)

* added Reload/Restart steam buttons:
![ATOMS Root Menu](https://github.com/Plaer1/ATOMS-Media/blob/abe7b3d73d615aa63d58135309754ad3ba80a13d/restartaloadMenu.png)

* Dim the artwork of uninstalled games in the library:

* Hides any personal ickyness. from your steam profile (only works for you, the world still knows what you did).
  
* You can use the arrow keys to navigate the steam discovery que.

* You can use ``'Control' + '+'`` and ``'Control' + '-'`` to zoom in and out on the non-library pages. 

## Known bugs/to-do's
<small>If you find **any bugs** not listed here, please don't hesitate to contact me in the place(s) listed above to report new issues.</small>
* The ITAD integration doesn't show any bundles, etc, just the main game on the page.
 * ***Big picture mode is not done**, this is however a very high priority, as I have a steam deck and would like to get that part of the skin on the CSS loader repo.
 * Skin is not tested on MacOS please let me know what's not working and I'll add it to the to-do list!
 * Most of the web pages are still running a hacky version of "[webkit.css](https://github.com/AikoMidori/steam-dark-mode/blob/master/webkit.css)" and as such there are tons of accents that are still the vanilla steam blue, (hopefully all the backgrounds at least are dark-mode however). I will be updating this file myself eventually, however I'm waiting on an anticipated big update from Valve first (so we'll see when it happens if ever ðŸ˜´ðŸ˜´ðŸ˜´).
* The "translations" for the "Reload Steam", and "Restart Steam" buttons are google translate and as-such are most likely **all wrong** if anyone who is multilingual could help out here that would be quite appreciated!
* On that same note, I will be implementing the correct regional pricing for the ITAD support, *before* I fix all the translations, it's just easier to start there. I am very sorry for any inconvienance this causes.
